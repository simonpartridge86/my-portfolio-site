# My Portfolio Site

This web app was created to showcase my coding projects for prospective employers.

The main technologies used were React and Styled Components.

This site can be viewed in deployment at [simonpartridge.me](https://www.simonpartridge.me/)

Notes:

Backend setup - strapi app installation required switching to node version 14.21.2
Followed Net Ninja Strapi Crash Course on YouTube
